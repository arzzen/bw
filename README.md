# Bitcoin brain wallet inspector

Requires package: "dc", "the unix desktop calculator".
Requires package: "openssl", "Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools".

Steps I recommend:

1. Disconnect your computer from Internet, WIFI etc (physically) and make sure nobody stand near your display.
2. Imagine a password and generate your wallet using "./bw -p areallycomplexpassword".
3. Write down the "Address uncompressed" - it's your Bitcoin address.
4. Destroy your computer or zero-fill your disk a number of times and re-install your OS.

Voila! You may now send money to your brain wallet even though your computer never touched Internet. Should be safe from
any kind of digital threat such as keyboard sniffer, virus, trojan etc.

Your wallet can't get stolen physically but they get kick yer ass to extract the password from you (so create several).
Your wallet may get brute forced in the future but you could renew your password every year or more frequent.
